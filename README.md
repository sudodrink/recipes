*sudo drink:*

In the initial idea phase - the basic concept is an open source energy drink. 25% (or some number) of the profit is donated to FOSS projects. If the brand is successful it is the perfect brand to heavily sponsor hackathons, training programs, general geek/code things. Just in the idea phase now. If you have ideas, recipes etc - please contribute. I am working on cost/timeline to do a fundraising campaign.

# FORMAT

(Suggesting to build a format for posting recipe items; some sort of recipe item style.)

Option 1: Set a style for building recipes in this repo.

	Recipe Name: <Recipe_Name> (Must be a 'sudo command')
	Creator: <Your_Name_Here>
	Ingredients: <Ingredients,List,here>
	Instructions: <Let_the_instruction_commence>

Option 2: Use existing community tools to build and host recipes elsewhere.  (ie: https://cookpad.com)  Set up a community around these recipes, and allow everyone access to them there, instead of just locked here in the repo.  It is an open source community effort after all.
