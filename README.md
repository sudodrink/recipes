*sudo drink:*

In the initial idea phase - the basic concept is an open source energy drink. 25% (or some number) of the profit is donated to FOSS projects. If the brand is successful it is the perfect brand to heavily sponsor hackathons, training programs, general geek/code things. Just in the idea phase now. If you have ideas, recipes etc - please contribute. I am working on cost/timeline to do a fundraising campaign.
